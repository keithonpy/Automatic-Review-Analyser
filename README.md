# Automatic Review Analyser

The goal of the project is to design a classifer to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, which is originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to be +1 or -1 scale representing a positive or negative review respectively.


There are three types of linear classifers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm and the Pegasos algorithm.
